# streamlit_update_local_csv
Trial Python script to update csv file locally with Streamlit app

This is a practice script on the topic 'Update CSV Locally With Streamlit App'

In this script, I have the filepath set to a specific location in my computer.
Feel free to change change it to your data file's location.

Also, the add_col1, add_col2, add_col3 variables correspond to the 'col1', 'col2', 'col3' column of my data.
You can replace them with your own column head too.

Have fun coding.
